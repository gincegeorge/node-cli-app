### Why Build a CLI App?
1. Automate tasks
2. Create tools for developers
3. Interact with systems and manage flows


### Real World Examples
I  created several CLIs that provide huge value:

- A CLI that manages dynamic pipelines in the CI/CD flows — no more manual configuration or waiting between processes.
- A CLI that sets up and manages local dockerized development environments.
- A CLI that runs predefined steps for migrations.
Now you’ll see how easy it is to make one.
